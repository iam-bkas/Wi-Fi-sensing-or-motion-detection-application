Changes in wireless signals to infer movement without cameras. Algorithms track these changes over time to detect occupancy, gestures, or events. Key signal inputs include RSSI fluctuations, Channel State Information (CSI), and Doppler features. With multiple antennas, devices can estimate directionality and sometimes range.
